DeFi Wallet Scoring
Welcome! 👋
This project is all about understanding DeFi wallet behavior. We simulate and analyze thousands of wallet transactions, assign each wallet a score, and explain what makes a wallet “good” or “risky.” If you’re curious about DeFi analytics, wallet health, or just want to see some cool data science in action, you’re in the right place!

🚀 What does this project do?
Generates synthetic DeFi transactions (so you can play with realistic data, no blockchain needed!)

Extracts behavioral features from each wallet, like how often they repay, how many assets they use, and how volatile their activity is.

Scores every wallet using a transparent, weighted system.

Analyzes the best and worst wallets, showing what makes them stand out.

🛠️ How does it work?
Synthetic Data Generation:
The script creates 100,000 fake DeFi transactions for 500 wallets. Each wallet does things like deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, and sometimes gets liquidated-just like in real DeFi protocols.

Feature Engineering:
For each wallet, we measure things like:

How many transactions they make

How many different assets they use

Their average collateral and repayment ratios

How often they get liquidated

How “spiky” or “smooth” their activity is (volatility)

Whether they behave like flash loan attackers

Scoring:
We normalize all these features and combine them using a set of weights (see the code for details). Each wallet ends up with a score between 0 and 100.

Analysis:
The script prints out the top and bottom wallets, with a plain-English summary of their strengths and weaknesses.

🤔 Why would I use this?
To learn about DeFi wallet behavior and risk

To test wallet scoring models before using real blockchain data

To build your own DeFi analytics or wallet health dashboard
