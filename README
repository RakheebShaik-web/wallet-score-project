# DeFi Wallet Scoring

This project analyzes and scores DeFi wallet behaviors using synthetic transaction data.  
It demonstrates feature engineering, wallet scoring, and analysis using Node.js.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Simulates realistic DeFi transactions across multiple assets and actions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts behavioral metrics such as repayment consistency, collateral ratio, activity duration, and more.
- **Wallet Scoring:** Assigns a score to each wallet based on weighted behavioral features.
- **Analysis:** Outputs top and bottom performing wallets with explanations of their strengths and weaknesses.

## How It Works

1. **Synthetic Data Generation:**  
   The script generates 100,000 synthetic transactions for 500 wallets, covering actions like deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, and liquidation.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   For each wallet, the script computes features such as:
   - Transaction count and frequency
   - Unique assets interacted with
   - Collateral and repayment ratios
   - Liquidation frequency
   - Behavior volatility and flash loan-like patterns

3. **Scoring:**  
   Each behavioral feature is normalized and weighted. The script computes a final score (0-100) for each wallet.

4. **Analysis:**  
   The top and bottom wallets are analyzed, highlighting key strengths and issues for each.
